("The first ever self loading pistol ever made was the Borshardt C93 pistol made in 1893. Rejected by both America and Germany, the creator, Hugo Borshardt claimed his pistol was flawless. Eventually he was kicked off the team after mediocre sales and a new person worked on the C93's design, George Luger who eventually made the P08 Luger pistol off the C93's design.", "While the C93 Borshardt was the first self loading pistol, it was not the first successful one. The Mauser C96 was the first commercially successful pistol, made by two brothers and sponsored by Paul Mauser (who didn't really like the gun), the C96 was a 10 round semi automatic pistol which was reloading by stripper clips from the top of the gun, an off mechanic now for a pistol but simple enough for when it was made. It saw great commercial success with sales across the globe,in particular by the central powers of WW1 and even the Nazis. It's even recognizable in eyes of the uninformed public due to it being a basis of Han Solo's blaster in the Star Wars movies.")
